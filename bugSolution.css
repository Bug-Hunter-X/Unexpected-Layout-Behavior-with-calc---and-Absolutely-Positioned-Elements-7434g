To fix this issue, ensure that the parent container has a defined width, either explicitly set or implicitly determined by its content.  Consider using flexbox or grid layout to manage the positioning and sizing of elements more robustly and avoid potential conflicts with `calc()`. Alternatively, if the container width is truly dynamic, using viewport units (`vw`) or other relative units within the `calc()` function may be necessary to ensure consistent layout.  For example, changing `width: calc(100% - 10px);` to `width: calc(90vw - 10px);` might resolve the issue by accounting for the viewport width.  If relative units do not work well, you can also use JavaScript to recalculate the width based on the container size.
