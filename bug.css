The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly, leading to unexpected results.  For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` inside a `width` property of an element that is positioned absolutely within a container might not work as expected, if the container's width is not explicitly defined or is itself calculated based on its contents. This can happen when the container shrinks in width and the absolute element does not adjust automatically based on the `calc()` resulting in an element overlapping with others.
