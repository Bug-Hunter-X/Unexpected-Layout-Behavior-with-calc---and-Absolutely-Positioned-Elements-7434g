This repository demonstrates a common CSS layout issue involving the `calc()` function and absolutely positioned elements. The bug arises from unexpected behavior when using `calc()` to determine the width of an absolutely positioned element within a container that has a dynamically determined width.  The solution provides a corrected approach to ensure consistent and predictable layout.
